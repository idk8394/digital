<sub>The eighth generation V10 is designed for riders looking to emulate their heroes or find the best lines in the bike park. It’s for those who understand there’s no substitute for a proper downhill bike. Lap after lap, day after day, nothing compares to riding a downhill bike.</sub>

<sub>When you can only have one bike, and your mission is to ride it into oblivion, this is the one. From manicured bike parks to blown-out loamy berms, alpine lines to backyard trails, the Bronson feels just as at home in the air as it does in the dirt. For the rider with a Peter Pan disposition or anyone looking to get into a pan-flat tabletop position, the Bronson encourages bad behavior.</sub>
